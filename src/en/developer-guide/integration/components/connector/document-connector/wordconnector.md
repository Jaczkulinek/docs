You will find word connector in TALXIS.Connectors.Word.zip solution which you can import to your environment. 
Connector contains two actions:
1. Convert Word To PDF
2. Fill Word Template

## Making connection

There are currently two ways to make connection:
1. You can use an api key. This one is generated for every customer.
